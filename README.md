## Specifications
### Program takes inputted user name and user inputted integer 'n', enumerates from 0 up to n (0, 1, 2, up to n), and replaces some of the numbers according to the following rules, listed here in decreasing priority:

* _Program replaces numbers divisible by 3 with "I'm sorry, [user name]. I'm afraid I can't do that. "_
  * _Example Input: 12_
  * _Example Output: I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that._
* _Program replaces numbers containing the digit 1 with "Boop!"_
  * _Example Input: 11_
  * _Example Output: Boop!_
* _Program replaces numbers containing the digit 0 with "Beep!"_
  * _Example Input: 20_
  * _Example Output: Beep!_
  * _Please note that since zero is divisble by all numbers (including three), the number zero itself will return "I'm sorry Dave" etc._
