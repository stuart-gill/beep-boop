## Specifications
### Program takes a user inputted integer 'n', enumerates from 0 up to n (0, 1, 2, up to n), and replaces some of the numbers according to the following rules, listed here in decreasing priority:
*_Program replaces numbers divisible by 3 with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that. "_*
**_Example Input: 12_**
**_Example Output: I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that._**
*_Program replaces numbers containing the digit 1 with "Boop!"_*
**_Example Input: 11_**
**_Example Output: Boop!_**
*_Program replaces numbers containing the digit 0 with "Beep!"_*
**_Example Input: 20_**
**_Example Output: Beep!_**
**_Please note that since zero is divisble by all numbers (inluding three), the number zero itself will return "I'm sorry Dave" etc._**
